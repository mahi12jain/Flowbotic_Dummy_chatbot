## AI & Technology Questions

### Q5: What LLM (Language Model) do you use?
**A:** We support multiple LLMs to match different needs:
- **Llama 3.1 8B** (Recommended) - Best balance of performance and cost
- **Mistral 7B** - Best for budget-conscious deployments
- **GPT-4o** - Premium option for enterprise deployments
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Best for complex reasoning tasks
- **Custom Models** - Fine-tuned versions specific to your industry

================================================================================
Source: frequently_asked_questions.md | Chunk: 5/24
================================================================================
### Q6: What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
**A:** RAG combines a language model with a knowledge retrieval system:
1. **Retrieval**: Your business documents are stored in a vector database
2. **Augmentation**: When a user asks a question, we find relevant documents
3. **Generation**: The LLM generates a response based on retrieved information

**Benefits:**
- Responses are grounded in your actual data (no hallucinations)
- Always up-to-date when you update knowledge base
- More accurate and trustworthy responses
- Lower cost than fine-tuning alone

### Q7: How does conversation memory work?
**A:** Our chatbot maintains context across multiple interactions:
- **Short-term Memory**: Current conversation is maintained in context window
- **Session Memory**: We track 5-10 previous exchanges in the session
- **User Memory**: We remember key facts about the user across sessions
- **Conversation Threading**: References to "that" or "your previous order" are understood

================================================================================
Source: frequently_asked_questions.md | Chunk: 6/24
================================================================================
**Example:**
```
User: What's your pricing?
Bot: [Provides pricing]

User: Does that include WhatsApp integration?
Bot: [Understands "that" = pricing and answers specifically]

User: How long does setup take?
Bot: [Context: knows user is interested in WhatsApp integration]
```

### Q8: What is RLHF and DPO? How do they improve the chatbot?
**A:** Both methods use human feedback to improve the model:

**RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):**
- Multi-step process: collect feedback → train reward model → optimize policy with RL
- More complex but handles nuanced feedback
- Takes longer to train (weeks)
- Higher computational cost

**DPO (Direct Preference Optimization):**
- Direct optimization of preferences without RL phase
- Simpler and faster to train (days)
- Lower computational requirements
- Better results in many cases
- **Recommended for most businesses**
